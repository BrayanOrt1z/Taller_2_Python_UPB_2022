# Taller_2_Python_UPB_2022
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brayan Ortiz
- In this repository you will find a program that facilitates the analysis of the sales of a business over a year.
- This program is the result of an activity called: Analysis and Visualization of Business Sales Data.
- The proposed objectives for this activity are as follows.
- 1) Use Python libraries for numerical calculations (Numpy) and data visualization (Matplotlib).
- 2) Use programming tools (Jupyter Notebook, GitHub Desktop) for algorithm development using the Python language.
