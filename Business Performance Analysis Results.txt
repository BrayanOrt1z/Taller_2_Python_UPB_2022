Based on the information provided by the images and the tables above, we can conclude that:
The months with the highest sales are the months that were above average sales. And they are the following:

 Months With The Highest Sales   	   Values

            April                	   35129000

            June                 	   31368600

            July                 	   34837700

           October               	   34526800

The months with the lowest sales are those that were below average. These are:

 Months With Lower Sales    	     Values

       January              	    27200500

       February             	    27012500

        March               	    30552600

         May                	    28236000

        August              	    27727600

       September            	    30742400

       November             	    30868900

Another important aspect is that it can be seen in the sales growth table that there are abrupt percentage drops in some months compared to the sales of the previous month, which indicates that in those months the strategies used to sell are not very efficient.
For the expenses part, in order to define which are the months with higher or lower expenses, not only the average expenses must be taken into account, but also other factors such as the following must be considered: The type of business and the area of activity. Each business and its area has its own characteristics to define operating expenses. It is also necessary to know what percentage of expenses is acceptable to the business owner. Now, if we base ourselves only on the graph and the average expenses, the months with the lowest and highest expenses are the following:

 Months With Lower Expenses     	     Values

         February               	    27200500

          March                 	    27012500

          April                 	    30552600

           May                  	    28236000

          June                  	    27727600

          July                  	    30742400

          August                	    30868900

         November               	    30868900

 Months With Higher Expenses         	  Values

         January                     	 16245388

        September                    	 15385074

         October                     	 16942889

         December                    	 13551400

For the months with lower and higher utilities we made focus on comparing the months that are above or below the average utility value.

 Months With Lower Utilities    	     Values

         January                	    10955112

         February               	    14184227

           May                  	    15622888

          August                	    14243701

         September              	    15357326

         November               	    17373635

 Months With Higher Utilities   	     Values

           March                	    19987721

           April                	    22926536

           June                 	    19366303

           July                 	    22128100

          October               	    17583911

          December              	    10955112

On the other hand, the values found in the standard deviation table show that the data is not very scattered, so this translates into a profitable business that is not volatile. However, it is possible to improve business performance if the owner decides to plan new strategies to increase sales and optimize business expenses.
